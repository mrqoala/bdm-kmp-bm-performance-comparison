# bdm-kmp-bm-performance-comparison





This project implements and compares the performance of three classical string-matching algorithms:
	•	BDM (Backwards DAWG Matching)
	•	KMP (Knuth–Morris–Pratt)
	•	BM (Boyer–Moore)

The code is designed to provide a simple and straightforward user experience.

🚀 Requirements
	•	Have Python installed on your computer, or use a platform that allows Python execution.
	•	Keep all project files in the same folder.
	•	Note: if the file adn.txt does not exist, it will be generated automatically.
⸻

▶️ Usage
	1.	Run the file main.py.
	2.	The program will prompt for a number between 6 and 10, which determines the length of the random pattern to be searched:
\text{pattern length} = 2^{\text{chosen number}}
	3.	The program will then display the execution times in seconds for each algorithm.

📊 Expected Output
The program prints the execution times (in seconds) of each string-matching algorithm directly to the console.
